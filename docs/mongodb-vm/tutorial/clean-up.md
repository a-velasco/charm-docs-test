# Clean up the environment

In this tutorial, weâ€™ve successfully:
* Deployed MongoDB on LXD
* Scaled our deployment 
* Added and removed database users
* Enabled and disabled TLS

You may now keep your MongoDB deployment running to continue experimenting, or remove it entirely to free up resources on your machine.

<!-- TODO: if using multipass, change this section to just remove mp vm -->
## Remove Charmed MongoDB
